# ✅ Task-1: To-Do List Application (File Handling + OOP)

## 😊 Description
A simple To-Do List project made using Python. This project contains **two versions** — one is with basic file handling using functions, and the other is an OOP-based version with class structure. Both versions store tasks in a text file, so the tasks stay saved even after closing the app.

I made this as part of my **CODSOFT Python Internship** — learned file handling, functions, and OOP in Python while doing this.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Add Tasks
- ✅ View Current Tasks (Numbered)
- ✅ Remove Tasks
- ✅ Tasks auto-save to a text file
- ✅ Loads saved tasks automatically when the program starts

## 🔗 Versions Included
1. **File Handling Version (Functional)**  
→ Basic Python functions, directly works with files.

2. **OOP Version (Class-Based)**  
→ Clean with methods like add, view, remove, and save. More like how real backend works.

## 📂 Folder Structure
/Task-1-To-Do-List
├── ToDo_in_filehandling.py # File handling version
├── ToDo_in_OOP.py # OOP version
├── To-Do.txt # Task file (auto-created)
└── README.md # This file

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jxck-007/CODSOFT.git

2.Navigate to folder:
cd CODSOFT/Task-1-To-Do-List

2.Run any file you want:
python ToDo_in_filehandling.py
or
python ToDo_in_OOP.py

📜 Requirements
✅ Python 3.x

🔥 No external libraries needed (only built-in pathlib for OOP version)

📑 Notes
When you start the program, it will check if To-Do.txt exists.

If not, it auto-creates the file.

Any task you add is saved permanently in the file.

Removing tasks updates the file instantly.
